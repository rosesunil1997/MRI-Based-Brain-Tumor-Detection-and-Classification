# MRI-Based-Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classification

In the 
proposed system, a machine learning based system using 
Matlab has been developed for automatic detection and 
classification of brain tumor from MRI. The detected tumor 
is classified into benign or malignant. Benign tumors are a 
lump of abnormal non-cancerous cells which does not 
spread, whereas malignant tumors are cancerous cells 
which may spread further. Improving the ability to identify 
early-stage tumors is an important goal for physicians, 
because early detection is a key factor in producing 
successful treatments. An interactive user interface using 
Matlab GUI has also been developed to make the system 
user-friendly.
